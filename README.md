# SpeechFun
Make your computer talk! A Winforms app that lets you do just that.

It's a Winforms app that lets you play around with the spoken word.To the best of my knowledge, the app was written using Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

# Imports
System and System.Windows.Forms seem to make up the very basic windowing and variable functionality. System.Speech.Synthesis is the fun stuff.

# Use
Users enter a specific phrase to be spoken back to them. Two buttons exist on the form - a Speak button, and an Exit button.

# Bugs/Errors/Obvious issues
This is an absolute barebones app. As such, errors with user input and program execution are possible. My guess is you'll want to wrap the voice-speaking code in a try-catch set to prevent showstopping problems.

# Why in the WORLD did you write it using Winforms?
1. Because I could
2. Because I know how to code Winforms (well-enough at least)
3. Because knocking things together in Wiforms is fun (and reminds me of my earlier "easter egg" coding days)

Import into Visual Studio 2015 Community (or a newer version) and enjoy!

(Please note: I haven't tested this on any newer Microsoft Visual Studio IDEs yet.)
